version: v1.9.0
summary: An image for Kubeflow's admission-webhook
description: |
  Admission webhook controller in general, intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server, 
  and can modify and/or validate the requests. Here the admission webhook is implemented to 
  modify pods based on the available PodDefaults. When a pod creation request is received, 
  the admission webhook looks up the available PodDefaults which match the pod's label. 
  It then, mutates the Pod spec according to PodDefault's spec.

  # The go plugin uses go install to build and install the "admission-webhook" binary at
  # /bin/admission-webhook, which is undesirable as it is expected to be in /webhook.
  # The go plugin does not offer any mechanism for passing custom install paths, so we have
  # to use override-build instead to make sure the binary is placed in the expected path.
